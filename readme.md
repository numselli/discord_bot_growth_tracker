# An easy way to visually view the growth of your discord bot.

## If you are looking at setting this up your own bot I recommend using [statcord](https://statcord.com/) over this program

## How to setup
1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download this repo
3. Open cmd or terminal type `cd ` then drag the folder for this repo into the cmd/terminal window and hit enter.
4. type `npm i` and hit enter
5. edit the `config.json` file
    1. checkInterva this is how often the chart will get new information. it is written in the cron format, you can use [this site](https://crontab.guru/) to generate this<br>default: every 24 hours
    2. websitePort this is part of the URL used to view the chart. this can be any four-digit number from `0001` to `9999`. <br> default: 6969
    3. discordAuthorization put your discord user token here, its not used for anything but authenticating with discord. I recommend using an alt accountâ€™s token for this, since this might be agent discord's terms of service.
    4. botIDs this is where you put the id's of the bots that you want to track
6. type `pm2 start index.js --name bot-growth-tracker` and hit enter
7. go to `127.0.0.1:`port-number in your web browser

## todo
- [ ] get server count and name from top.gg and other sources before getting from discord. this is to reduce the possibility of being detected as a self-bot by discord.
